  desc: Room temperature ingredients make all the difference in this cake. You can
    get more loft from non-chilled egg whites, and room-temperature butter is easier
    to cream (beat together) with sugar than the straight- from-the-fridge stuff.
    The fluffy egg whites and properly creamed butter and sugar mean tender, light
    cake. And room-temp butter and cream cheese will translate to creamy, smooth frosting
    instead of a sticky mess filled with lumps.
  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 350\xB0F. Coat two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high\
    \ sides with nonstick spray; line bottom of pans with parchment paper rounds."
  - Mix flour and coconut in medium bowl. Whisk buttermilk and baking soda in small
    bowl. Using electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in large bowl until light and
    fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg yolks and beat to blend. Add flour mixture in
    3 additions alternately with buttermilk mixture in 2 additions, beating just to
    blend after each addition. Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites and 1/4 teaspoon
    salt in another large bowl until peaks form. Add 1/3 of egg white mixture to batter;
    fold into batter just to blend. Fold in remaining egg white mixture in 2 additions.
    Divide batter between pans.
  - Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
    Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes. Run small sharp knife around sides of
    cake pans. Invert cakes onto racks. Carefully peel off parchment. Cool cakes completely.
  - 'Using electric mixer, beat sugar, cream cheese, butter, and vanilla in large
    bowl until blended. Place 1 cake layer, flat side up, on plate. Spread with 1
    cup frosting. Place second layer, flat side up, atop frosting. Spread remaining
    frosting over top and sides of cake. Sprinkle some of coconut over top of cake;
    pat more coconut on sides of cake. DO AHEAD: can be made 1 day ahead. Cover with
    cake dome and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.'

  desc: Pastry chef Jennifer Jones of Topolobampo in Chicago shared this recipe as
    part of a Cinco de Mayo feature on Mexican desserts. Jones encourages you to use
    different fruits in this refreshing dessert, but recommends sticking to ones that
    are sweet but have acidity. Raspberries are a perfect example.
  directions:
  - 'In the bowl of a food processor, combine the mangoes, orange zest, sugar, lime
    juice, and 1 cup water. Process until the mixture is smooth. Pour through a fine-mesh
    sieve set over a large bowl then press gently on and discard any solids (there
    will be about 3 cups syrup). Transfer to a freezer-safe dish, cover with plastic,
    and freeze until the mixture is firm 2 inches in from the sides, about 2 hours.
    Scrape into a food processor and process until the mixture is slushy. Repeat the
    freezing and processing 2 more times, then freeze for at least 1 hour before serving.
    DO AHEAD: The ice can be made ahead and stored in the freezer, well wrapped, up
    to 2 weeks.'

  desc: '"My profession as a real estate agent requires a lot of my time," writes
    Edi Meadows Morrissette of Westin, Florida, "so it helps that I am lightning-fast
    in the kitchen. I cook every day, and on the weekends I sometimes make three meals
    a day. I accomplish that by following my main cooking principles: (1) do a lot
    of prep work, and (2) keep the kitchen well stocked. For example, at holiday time
    I might chop onions in advance or bake bread the day before company arrives. And
    since I converted the bedroom next to my kitchen into a pantry for extra storage,
    I know I''ll always have the right ingredients at my fingertips."'

  directions:
  - In a kettle combine the potatoes, peeled and halved, the celery root or Jerusalem
    artichokes, and the carrots with cold water to cover and simmer the vegetables,
    covered, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they are tender. Reserve 1 cup of the
    cooking liquid and drain the vegetables in a colander. Force the potatoes through
    a ricer into a large bowl or mash them in the bowl with a potato masher. In a
    food processor puree the celery root or the Jerusalem artichokes with the butter
    until the mixture is smooth and stir the mixture into the potatoes. Using the
    coarse side of a grater shred the carrots into the bowl and combine the mixture
    well, adding salt and pepper to taste and enough of the reserved cooking liquid
    to achieve the desired consistency. The puree may be made 1 day in advance and
    kept covered and chilled.

  desc: This recipe yields enough sauce to glaze three pounds of meat. We doubled
    it for the chicken and ribs at our barbecue party. You'll use about half to marinate
    and glaze the meat while cooking, and the rest as a condiment on the buffet for
    those who like it really saucy.
  directions:
  - Heat the oil in a large saucepan and sweat the onion until tender and translucent.
    Add all remaining ingredients and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the sauce from
    the heat and use a handheld blender to process it to a smooth paste. (Alternatively,
    transfer it to an upright blender and back again.) Simmer gently for an additional
    5 minutes.
  - Separate the sauce into two containers. Use one to marinate and glaze the meat
    during grilling. Reserve the remainder for use as a sauce at the table.

  desc: These tasty treats were inspired by steakhouse flavors. For those who observe
    the kosher prohibition against serving meat and dairy together, they're delicious
    on their own. If you don't keep kosher, try them alongside grilled and roasted
    poultry and meat.
  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 200\xB0F. Place 2 nonstick baking sheets in oven."
  - Using box grater or food processor fitted with grating disc, coarsely grate onion
    and place in colander set in sink. Coarsely grate potatoes, add to colander, and
    set aside to drain.
  - In large mixing bowl, lightly beat eggs. Whisk in flour, then stir in cheese and
    garlic.
  - Press potatoes and onion to extract as much liquid as possible, then add to egg/flour
    mixture. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Using wooden spoon
    or hands, mix well, but do not overwork.
  - In heavy-bottomed, 12-inch skillet over moderately high heat, heat 1 tablespoon
    oil and 1 tablespoon butter until hot but not smoking. Drop 4 scant 1/4-cup portions
    of batter into pan and flatten with spatula to form four 3-inch pancakes.
  - Fry until bottoms are golden-brown, 4 to 5 minutes, then turn over and fry until
    golden-brown and crisp, an additional 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels
    to drain; season immediately with salt and pepper. Keep warm on baking sheets
    in oven while making remaining pancakes.
  - Using paper towels, carefully wipe out pan. Add 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon
    butter and fry 4 more pancakes. Repeat with remaining batter, wiping out pan and
    adding 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter before each batch. Just before
    serving, sprinkle with parsley.
  - Serve pancakes hot with Creamed Spinach Dip.

  desc: This fruit butter makes a quick dessert. It's also a great snack on bread
    or toast. We use it in a low-fat recipe for a moist and chunky apple butter spice
    cake. We have found preserving in half-pint (250 mL) jars convenient, since that
    recipe calls for that amount of apple butter. But if you use larger jars, you'll
    have lots left for other uses.
  directions:
  - 1. Cut McIntosh apples into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Cut Granny Smith apples into
    smaller dice.
  - 2. Combine apples and cider in a very large stainless steel or enamel saucepan.
    Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and
    boil gently for 20 minutes or until mixture is reduced by half.
  - 3. Stir in sugar and lemon juice. Return to a boil, reduce heat, and boil gently
    for about 25 minutes or until mixture is very thick. There should still be some
    tender apple chunks remaining. Remove from heat.
  - 4. Ladle into sterilized jars and process as directed for Shorter Time Processing
    Procedure .
  - Add 2 tsp (10 mL) ground cinnamon and 1/2 tsp (2 mL) each ground cloves and allspice
    with the sugar.

  desc: Slow-roasting at a very low temperature results in extremely tender salmon.
    The richness of the fish is accented by a salty-sweet red-wine sauce, which thickens
    into a syrupy glaze during cooking.
  directions:
  - "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 225\xB0F."
  - Finely grate ginger on small holes of a box grater into a fine-mesh sieve, then
    set sieve over a bowl and press on ginger to extract 2 teaspoons juice. Bring
    soy sauce, wine, mirin, brown sugar, and ginger juice to a boil in a 3- to 3 1/2-quart
    heavy saucepan. Reduce heat to moderate and briskly simmer, stirring occasionally,
    until syrupy and reduced to about 1 cup, 45 to 55 minutes. Transfer to a bowl,
    then quick-chill by setting bowl in a larger bowl of ice water and stirring occasionally
    for 5 minutes. Stir in lime juice. Reserve 1/2 cup glaze in a small bowl for brushing
    after roasting.
  - Line a 17- by 12-inch heavy shallow baking pan with foil and coat foil with oil
    (1 tablespoon).
  - Arrange salmon, skin side down, diagonally in pan, then spoon about 2 tablespoons
    glaze over salmon, spreading it evenly with back of spoon. Let stand 5 minutes,
    then spoon and spread another 2 tablespoons glaze over salmon.
  - Roast 15 minutes. Remove from oven and glaze again (use a clean spoon each time),
    then roast 10 minutes more. Repeat glazing and continue to roast until fish is
    just cooked through (opaque), 10 to 20 minutes more (35 to 45 minutes total, depending
    on thickness of fish; check frequently after 35 minutes). Transfer with 2 wide
    metal spatulas to a platter, then coat with a final layer of reserved glaze (about
    2 tablespoons) using a clean spoon. Serve remaining glaze on the side if desired.

    Adults, tweens, teens, kids, whoever. You''ve seen it a hundred times at your

    A line around the corner, kids playing, everybody''s happy; it''s the sweet life.
    For a diabetic, that could go two ways: One way is horribly wrong, and that''s
    if there''re no sugar-free items on the board. Or, totally great because they
    do offer some special items for people with some sort of dietary restriction.
    Or there''s Plan C, which is that you make a batch of this silky, creamy, coconut
    yogurt at home and relax with the fam on Sunday night. Let the others rush to
    the corner store and wait in line; your only fear will be whether or not your
    family leaves you any.'

  - In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, sweetener, coconut milk, cinnamon, and coconut
    extract. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let the mixture chill in the fridge

  directions:
  - 1. Place the orange skins, wine, vodka, coffee beans and the vanilla beans in
    a non-reactive bowl. Add half the sugar and stir.
  - 2. Place the remaining half of the sugar in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan over
    medium heat and let it caramelize to a deep golden, rotating the pan from time
    to time to make sure all of the sugar caramelizes evenly. Remove the pan from
    the heat and pour the caramel into the bowl holding the oranges and the liquid,
    being careful to pour slowly so that the caramel doesn't get on your skin. The
    caramelized sugar will immediately turn hard, but don't be concerned. It will
    eventually melt into the liquid.
  - 3. Cover the bowl and let sit for six days, stirring several times a day.
  - 4. Strain the wine through three thicknesses of cheesecloth and decant into bottles.
    Cork the bottles and let them sit for at least 1 month and up to 1 year before
    opening.

  desc: The humble potato, given a little something extra, always elicits oohs and
    aahs. This is especially true when it's tossed with an herb-infused oil and cooked
    on the grill.
  directions:
  - Prepare a gas grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-high heat; see Grilling
    Procedure .
  - Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch-thick slices and cook in a large pot of well-salted
    boiling water 10 minutes (potatoes will not be cooked through).
  - Meanwhile, stir together herbs, garlic, oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon
    pepper in a large shallow dish.
  - Drain potatoes well and transfer to herb oil, tossing gently to coat.
  - Transfer potatoes to grill, letting excess oil drip into dish (reserve oil in
    dish). Grill potatoes, covered, turning once or twice, until tender, about 5 minutes
    total. Return potatoes to dish and toss again with herb oil. Squeeze lemon wedge
    over potatoes. Season with salt and serve with additional lemon wedges.

  desc: Here's a good base recipe for using frozen berries to prepare a flavorful
    sauce. I find that frozen berries need to cook a little to make them less watery
    and to concentrate their flavor. Look for raspberries that come frozen in a bag.
    Feel the bag to make sure all of the individual berries are loose and not clumped
    together. Bags of frozen berries tend to taste better than those frozen in a block.
  directions:
  - 1 Combine the berries and sugar in a medium saucepan over low heat. Bring to a
    boil, stirring occasionally.
  - 2 Cook the berries and sugar for about 5 minutes, allowing them to boil very gently,
    or until they are slightly thickened.
  - 3 Cool the mixture and puree it in a blender. Strain the sauce into a bowl to
    remove the seeds.
  - 4 Stir in the lemon juice and Kirsch.
  - Pass the sauce in a sauceboat or bowl.
  - Keep the sauce covered and refrigerated before and after use.

  desc: "Rosemary's piney scent is so particular you could never mistake it for any\
    \ other herb. A handful of sprigs (left over from Beef Saut\xE9ed with White Wine\
    \ and Rosemary ) mingle with garlic to cast a spell over roasted potatoes, resulting\
    \ in something that's just right on a winter night."
  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 450\xB0F with a 4-sided heavy sheet pan in upper third."
  - Toss ingredients with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Spread in 1 layer
    on hot pan and roast 20 minutes. Loosen potatoes with a metal spatula and turn,
    arranging pale potatoes around outer edge of pan and golden potatoes in center
    (for even roasting). Roast 15 minutes, then loosen and turn potatoes over again.
    Roast until potatoes are golden and cooked through and edges are crisp, about
    10 minutes more.

  desc: The fried eggs add extra unctuousness to a clever carbonara.
  directions:
  - Whisk 4 eggs, both cheeses, garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in medium bowl; set
    aside. Cook pancetta in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp, about
    7 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer to small bowl. Reserve skillet with drippings.
  - Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until almost tender (about 3 minutes
    less than package directions); add broccoli rabe. Cook just until broccoli rabe
    is crisptender and pasta is tender, about 3 minutes longer. Drain pasta-broccoli
    rabe mixture, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Return hot pasta-broccoli rabe
    mixture to pot (off heat). Immediately add egg-cheese mixture, pancetta, and 1/4
    cup hot cooking liquid; toss to combine, adding more cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls
    to moisten as needed. Season to taste with salt and more pepper, if desired. Cover
    to keep warm.
  - Heat skillet with drippings over medium heat. Crack remaining 4 eggs into skillet;
    sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook until whites are opaque, about 2 minutes.
    Carefully turn eggs over; cook just until whites are set but yolks are still soft,
    about 1 minute longer. Remove from heat. Top pasta with eggs and serve.

  desc: This fruit butter makes a quick dessert. It's also a great snack on bread
    or toast. We use it in a low-fat recipe for a moist and chunky apple butter spice
    cake. We have found preserving in half-pint (250 mL) jars convenient, since that
    recipe calls for that amount of apple butter. But if you use larger jars, you'll
    have lots left for other uses.
  directions:
  - 1. Cut McIntosh apples into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Cut Granny Smith apples into
    smaller dice.
  - 2. Combine apples and cider in a very large stainless steel or enamel saucepan.
    Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and
    boil gently for 20 minutes or until mixture is reduced by half.
  - 3. Stir in sugar and lemon juice. Return to a boil, reduce heat, and boil gently
    for about 25 minutes or until mixture is very thick. There should still be some
    tender apple chunks remaining. Remove from heat.
  - 4. Ladle into sterilized jars and process as directed for Shorter Time Processing
    Procedure .
  - Add 2 tsp (10 mL) ground cinnamon and 1/2 tsp (2 mL) each ground cloves and allspice
    with the sugar.

    until it is smooth, remove the bowl from the pan, and let the chocolate cool slightly.
    In a bowl whisk together the goat cheese, the confectioners' sugar, the vanilla,
    and the lemon extract until the mixture is light and fluffy, whisk in the chocolate
    until the mixture is combined well, and chill the mixture, covered, for 1 hour,
    or until it is firm. Form heaping teaspoons of the mixture into balls and roll
    the balls in the cocoa powder. Chill the truffles on a baking sheet lined with
    waxed paper for 30 minutes, or until they are firm. The truffles keep in an airtight
    container, chilled, for 3 days.

  directions:
  - Wash the chicken and pat dry. Put the pieces into a large nonreactive glass or
    stainless steel bowl and pour the lime juice over them. Sprinkle with the minced
    garlic, a large pinch of salt, and several liberal grindings of black pepper.
    Toss until the seasoning is uniformly distributed and set aside to marinate for
    at least 1 hour, refrigerated. (Or cover and marinate overnight in the refrigerator;
    remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before you are ready to cook the chicken.)
  - "Place the corn flour in a paper or large plastic ziplock bag. Shake to coat the\
    \ inside. Fit a wire cooling rack over a cookie sheet and place it in the center\
    \ of the oven. Preheat the oven to 150\xB0F (or Warm setting). Fill a deep cast-iron\
    \ skillet, Dutch oven, or deep-fat fryer with enough lard or oil to come halfway\
    \ up the sides, at least 2 inches deep. Over medium-high heat, bring the fat to\
    \ 375\xB0F (hot but not smoking)."
  - "When the fat is hot, lift the chicken pieces a few at a time from their marinade,\
    \ allowing the excess to flow back into the bowl. Drop them into the bag of corn\
    \ flour, close the top, and shake until the chicken is well coated. Lift them\
    \ out of the corn flour, shake off the excess, and slip them into the fat. Repeat\
    \ until the pan is full without crowding. Fry, maintaining a temperature of 365\xB0\
    F, turning once, until the chicken is a rich golden brown and cooked through,\
    \ 12 to 15 minutes."
  - Lift the chicken from the fat, drain well, and transfer to the wire rack in the
    oven while you fry the remaining chicken. Serve hot, with hot sauce and lime wedges
    passed separately.
  - 'Note: If you like, you can spice up the marinade with a few hot red pepper flakes
    or with a few shots of hot sauce. Other common additions to the marinade are minced
    fresh ginger (about 2 quarter-sized slices, minced fine), rum, sugar, and chopped
    cilantro.'

  desc: Taking a cue from German potato salad, these Yukon Golds are smashed with
    a hot bacon dressing and then tossed with fresh dill. Steaming rather than boiling
    the potatoes keeps them fluffy.
  directions:
  - Steam potatoes in a large steamer rack set over boiling water, covered, until
    very tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
  - Meanwhile, cook bacon in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until crisp.
    Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, reserving fat in
    skillet. Add 2 tablespoons vinegar, sugar, and 3/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper
    to hot bacon fat, scraping up brown bits.
  - Transfer potatoes to a large bowl, reserving 1/2 cup steaming water. Add vinegar
    mixture to potatoes and smash with a potato masher to desired texture, adding
    reserved water if desired. Stir in dill, bacon, and vinegar, salt, and pepper
    to taste.

  desc: Here's a good base recipe for using frozen berries to prepare a flavorful
    sauce. I find that frozen berries need to cook a little to make them less watery
    and to concentrate their flavor. Look for raspberries that come frozen in a bag.
    Feel the bag to make sure all of the individual berries are loose and not clumped
    together. Bags of frozen berries tend to taste better than those frozen in a block.
  directions:
  - 1 Combine the berries and sugar in a medium saucepan over low heat. Bring to a
    boil, stirring occasionally.
  - 2 Cook the berries and sugar for about 5 minutes, allowing them to boil very gently,
    or until they are slightly thickened.
  - 3 Cool the mixture and puree it in a blender. Strain the sauce into a bowl to
    remove the seeds.
  - 4 Stir in the lemon juice and Kirsch.
  - Pass the sauce in a sauceboat or bowl.
  - Keep the sauce covered and refrigerated before and after use.

  desc: 'Treat this recipe as a basic template from which to have a blast mixing and
    matching different meats with different cheeses. The Parmesan is a must and not
    an option to switch out; it''s the magic ingredient that will make the meat more
    savory and any cheese you stuff in your slider taste cheesier.

    The recipe can be halved or doubled easily, so if there are a lot of kids in your
    crowd, you might want to cut back on the number you make. If a bunch of your drinking
    buddies are on their way over, however, you''ll likely want to do 1 1/2 times
    the recipe, or even double it.

    We''ve given you suggestions for toppers and meat-and-cheese combinations, but
    those are just ideas to get your imagination going. If the weather is cooperative,
    fire up your grill, but if you are grill-less, the broiler does a fine job. Any
    which way you do it, you can''t help but have fun!'
  directions:
  - Gently combine meat, eggs, cheese, parsley, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon
    pepper with your hands. (Do not overmix).
  - Form scant 1/4 cupfuls of meat mixture into about 30 meatballs. Push a cheese
    cube into center of each ball and encase meat around cheese, then slightly flatten
    each ball to a 2-inch diameter.
  - Preheat broiler. Put half of sliders on an oiled rack of a broiler pan and broil,
    turning over once, until just cooked through (no longer pink), 4 to 8 minutes
    total. Repeat with remaining sliders.
  - For easy entertaining, go with a gas grill. Preheat all burners on high, covered,
    10 minutes, then adjust heat to medium-high. Grill sliders, in batches if necessary,
    turning once, until just cooked through, 4 to 8 minutes total.
  - Make sliders with toppings and rolls.

  desc: 'Treat this recipe as a basic template from which to have a blast mixing and
    matching different meats with different cheeses. The Parmesan is a must and not
    an option to switch out; it''s the magic ingredient that will make the meat more
    savory and any cheese you stuff in your slider taste cheesier.

    The recipe can be halved or doubled easily, so if there are a lot of kids in your
    crowd, you might want to cut back on the number you make. If a bunch of your drinking
    buddies are on their way over, however, you''ll likely want to do 1 1/2 times
    the recipe, or even double it.

    Gingerbread and chunky applesauce make a perfect finale.
  directions:
  - Preheat broiler. Steam broccolini until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer
    to paper towels and pat dry. Broil bread on baking sheet until lightly toasted,
    about 1 minute per side. Spread top side of each bread slice with mustard-flavored
    mayonnaise. Top each with onion slice, broccolini and cheese. Broil until cheese
    melts and browns, about 2 minutes.

  desc: "I\u2019m sort of a snob when it comes to trying new recipes. I just seem\
    \ to like my old tried and true ones best, and it takes a lot for something new\
    \ to grab my attention. I had to have the recipe for this dip after I tried it\
    \ on Super Bowl Sunday 2006. Garth is a die-hard Steelers fan, so it was an exciting\
    \ day. Everybody always brings something for the party, and this was my friend\
    \ Kim\u2019s contribution. Being a good southern girl, I love anything with black-eyed\
    \ peas in it, but for you folks who are right now turning up your noses at the\
    \ idea of eating black-eyed peas, all I can say is just try it. In fact, maybe\
    \ I should name it something else for those skeptics. How about Pea Dippy?"
  directions:
  - "In an electric mixer or large mixing bowl, mix together the peas, jalape\xF1\
    os, 3 tablespoons of the reserved jalape\xF1o juice, cheddar, onion, butter, and\

  directions:
  - 1. Set a heavy-bottomed 12-inch skillet over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, or
    medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, while preparing the meal and seasoning the fish
    steaks. Three to four minutes before searing the fish steaks, turn on the exhaust
    fan and increase the heat to high.
  - 2. Set steaks on a plate, drizzle with oil; turn to coat. Sprinkle with salt and
    pepper.
  - 3. A minute or so after the residual oils in the skillet send up wisps of smoke,
    put the fish steaks in the pan. Cook over high heat until the steaks develop a
    thick, rich brown crust, about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes. Turn the steaks and continue
    to cook over high heat until the other sides develop a thick, rich brown crust
    and the fish is medium-rare to medium, 3 1/2 to 4 minutes longer. (For medium-well-done
    fish, turn the heat to low and cook, turning once, for 1 to 2 minutes longer.)
    Remove to a plate and let stand 5 minutes.
  - 4. Serve with lemon wedges, or an uncooked relish or flavored butter. Or make
    a pan sauce by adding 1/2 cup liquid to the skillet; boil until the liquid is
    reduced to about 1/4 cup. Tilting the skillet so that the reduced liquid is at
    one side of the pan, whisk in butter or other enrichments until the sauce is smooth
    and glossy.
  - Mash the horseradish and butter into a paste. Add the vinegar and season to taste
    with salt and pepper. Smear a tablespoon of flavored butter over each portion
    and serve immediately.

  desc: From here grow all other vinaigrettes. Use your instincts to vary the basic
    recipe. My everyday dressing almost always includes a bit of mustard which helps
    emulsify the dressing while adding tang.
  directions:
  - Combine all the ingredients except the shallot in a blender and turn the machine
    on; a creamy emulsion will form within 30 seconds. Taste and add more vinegar
    a teaspoon or two at a time until the balance tastes right to you.
  - Add the shallot and turn the machine on and off a few times until the shallot
    is minced within the dressing. Taste, adjust the seasoning , and serve. (This
    is best made fresh but will keep, refrigerated, for a few days; bring it back
    to room temperature and whisk briefly before using.)

  desc: Tapered eggplants and a mix of large and medium tomatoes will give your stacks
    a more graceful appearance.
  directions:
  - Blend basil with oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt in blender until finely chopped. Pour
    into a paper-towel- or coffee-filter-lined sieve set over a bowl and let drain
    20 minutes. Gather together sides of towel or filter and press gently on it to
    extract more oil. (You will have a generous 1/3 cup oil.) Reserve 1 tablespoon
    basil oil separately for serving. Scrape basil solids into a small bowl and reserve.
  - Prepare grill for cooking over medium-hot charcoal (moderate heat for gas); see
    "Grilling Procedure," below.
  - While grill heats, cut off bottoms of eggplants, then cut 6 (1/2-inch-thick) crosswise
    rounds from each, starting from cut end. Reserve remaining eggplant for another
    use. Cut 4 (1/3-inch-thick) rounds from large tomato and 2 center slices (1/3
    inch thick) from each medium tomato, reserving remaining tomato for another use.
  - Lightly brush eggplant rounds on both sides with basil oil and sprinkle with 1/2
    teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Grill on a lightly oiled grill rack, covered
    only if using a gas grill, turning over occasionally, lightly brushing eggplant
    with more basil oil occasionally if it looks dry, until eggplant is very tender,
    6 to 10 minutes. (Leave gas grill on.)
  - On baking pan, arrange 4 largest eggplant rounds side by side and spread each
    with a generous 1/2 teaspoon of reserved basil solids, then top each with 1 of
    4 largest tomato rounds. Season tomatoes with salt and pepper and top each with
    about 1 tablespoon feta. Make another layer with medium-size eggplant rounds,
    basil solids, medium tomato rounds, salt, pepper, and feta, then top with remaining
    eggplant and feta.
  - Set baking pan on grill and cook stacks, with grill cover closed, until heated
    through and cheese on top is softened, about 3 minutes. Transfer stacks to 4 plates
    and drizzle plates with reserved basil oil.
  - 'If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal.
    When charcoal turns grayish white (about 15 minutes from lighting), hold your
    hand 5 inches above grill rack to determine heat for charcoal as follows:'
  - 'Hot: When you can hold your hand there for 1 to 2 seconds'
  - 'Medium-hot: 3 to 4 seconds'
  - 'Low: 5 to 6 seconds'
  - If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then, if necessary,
    reduce to heat specified in recipe.

  desc: Long, slow cooking turns a supermarket chuck roast into something gloriously
    tender, flavorful, and aromatic. Leftovers are delicious shredded, heated in the
    sauce, and served over egg noodles.
  directions:
  - Halve onions lengthwise, then slice lengthwise 1/4 inch thick.
  - Pat beef dry and season all over with 2 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
    Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wide 5-to 6-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat until
    it shimmers. Brown beef on all sides, about 15 minutes, then transfer to a plate.
  - Cook onions with bay leaves and 1/2 teaspoon salt in remaining tablespoon oil
    in pot, scraping up brown bits from bottom and stirring occasionally, until onions
    are well browned, about 25 minutes.
  - "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350\xB0F with rack in middle. Cut a round of parchment\
    \ paper the diameter of the inside of pot (near the top). Set parchment round\
    \ aside."
  - Add beer and vinegar to onions and bring to a boil, stirring and scraping up brown
    bits. Add beef and meat juices from plate and return to a boil.
  - Cover with parchment round and lid and braise in oven until meat is very tender
    when pierced in several places with a meat fork, about 3 1/2 hours.
  - Transfer beef to a cutting board and let stand, loosely covered, 20 minutes. Cut
    off string, then slice meat. Skim off fat from sauce and discard bay leaves. Reheat
    if necessary.

    and roughly dice the flesh. Warm a large ceramic or glass mixing bowl by rinsing
    it with hot water. Toss the tomatoes in the bowl with the olive oil, mixed herbs,
    parsley, and ricotta cheese.
  - Bring the large pot of water back to a rolling boil, add the spaghetti, and cook
    until tender but still firm. Drain and add it immediately to the tomato mixture
    in the bowl. Sprinkle with the Parmigiano. Toss with tongs or two wooden spoons
    until the pasta is evenly coated. Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.
    Pass extra Parmigiano cheese at the table.

  desc: Japanese eggplants have thin skins and few seeds, just meaty, flavorful flesh
    that transforms into tender, creamy textured, fragrant, smoky goodness when grilled.
    The classic way to enjoy this dish is with just soy sauce or Ponzu and a mound
    of katsuobushi, dried shaved bonito flakes (a type of tuna). The dressing below
    is more contemporary but also fantastic. Either way, get your hands on these eggplants
    and grill them.
  directions:
  - Whisk together the soy sauce, lemon juice, and olive oil in a bowl to make the
    dressing; set aside. Score the stem end of each eggplant, making a circular cut
    in the skin (this will make the eggplant easier to peel). Poke a few holes into
    the eggplants with a skewer or fork to allow steam to escape as they grill.
  - Preheat a grill to medium. Grill for about 8 minutes, turning the eggplants a
    quarter turn every 2 minutes. Try to grill the eggplant all around. Test the eggplants
    for doneness by pressing against their sides with a pair of tongs. If the eggplants
    give easily, they're ready. Transfer the eggplants to a plate.
  - As soon as the eggplants are cool enough to handle, carefully peel off the skin
    (the skin comes off more easily if the eggplant is warm; don't let it cool completely).
    Once you've removed the skin, remove the stems, and slice each eggplant into 4
    pieces, cutting on an angle. Transfer the eggplant slices to a platter. Drizzle
    with dressing, sprinkle with the bonito, and serve.

    rumored to have been named for Anna Deslions, a famous courtesan in nineteenth-century
    Paris.
  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 400\xB0 F."
  - Cook bacon until crisp and crumble. Melt butter and lightly brush over bottom
    and sides of a well-seasoned cast-iron or non-stick 10-inch skillet.
  - With a sharp knife peel celery root and, using a mandoline or other manual slicer,
    cut crosswise into 1/16-inch-thick slices. Arrange 1 slice in center of skillet
    and arrange one layer of slices around center slice in a concentric circle, overlapping
    them slightly. Lightly brush layer with some of melted butter (being careful not
    to move slices) and sprinkle with one third bacon, 1 1/2 tablespoons Parmesan,
    3/4 teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon olives, and salt and pepper to taste. Repeat procedure
    twice but reverse direction of slices each time so that layers are even. Add one
    more layer of celery root. Brush top with any remaining butter and sprinkle with
    remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons Parmesan and remaining thyme. Cover top of skillet
    tightly with foil and bake celery root in middle of oven 20 minutes. Remove foil
    and bake 20 to 25 minutes more, or until celery root is tender and top and edges
    are golden brown.

    illustrates the diverging tastes and traditions of barbecue in the Carolinas.

  desc: "Farofa is the term for a side dish using toasted farinha de mandioca\u2014\
    in English, manioc flour, which is a dried flour similar in looks and texture\
    \ to breadcrumbs, made from yucca. The making of farofa as a dish couldn't be\
    \ easier. It is plain manioc flour toasted in butter. A few of the classic farofa\
    \ dishes include eggs and scallions, eggs and bacon, banana, bell peppers, and\
    \ dend\xEA oil, green beans and carrots, peas and corn, and so on and so forth.\
    \ Farofa can be extremely dry, since the manioc flour immediately sucks up all\
    \ the juices from anything it encounters, especially when it's served plain. The\
    \ trick to making a moist farofa is to use a small amount of manioc flour in proportion\
    \ to the other components, turning a side dish into a savory accompaniment that\
    \ is so tempting, you may even forget there is a main course."
  directions:
  - Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Add the manioc flour and toast
    it to a light golden color, stirring often, 8 to 10 minutes. Make sure to stir
    constantly, otherwise the flour will burn. Set aside.
  - In a nonstick skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat, and cook the scallions
    until they just start to soften. Save a few slices of scallion for garnish.
  - Whisk the eggs in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Pour the eggs
    into the scallions and scramble them lightly, being careful not to overcook them.
    Add the toasted manioc flour and stir everything together. Season with salt and
    pepper.
  - Pour into a serving dish and garnish with the reserved scallions.

  directions:
  - Remove leaves and trim stem end of cauliflower, leaving core intact. Place cauliflower
    core side down on a work surface. Using a large knife, slice cauliflower into
    four 1/2" "steaks" from center of cauliflower (some florets will break loose;
    reserve). Finely chop enough loose florets to measure 1/2 cup. Transfer chopped
    florets to a small bowl and mix with olives, sun-dried tomatoes, 1 tablespoon
    oil, parsley, and lemon juice. Season relish with salt and pepper.
  - "Preheat oven to 400\xB0. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large heavy ovenproof\

  desc: Zucchini bread is one of those things that is almost always good but rarely
    spectacular and a slice can serve as a breakfast, snack or dessert. Sprinkling
    it with sugar and grilling it so it becomes nicely caramelized moves it firmly
    in the dessert category (and, along with adding a spoonful of mascarpone, makes
    it much closer to spectacular).
  directions:
  - Light a grill or preheat a grill pan and oil the grates. Lightly brush both sides
    of the zucchini bread slices with oil, sprinkle with sugar, and grill over moderately
    high heat, turning once, until dark brown grill marks form on both sides, about
    2 minutes per side.
  - Transfer the zucchini bread to plates and top with a dollop or two of mascarpone.
    Spoon the berries on top and serve.

  desc: Although this flour, semolina, and egg mixture begins as a stiff dough, it
    cooks into beautiful, velvety noodles that are as smooth as butter. A pasta machine
    makes this recipe easy and foolproof. Store-bought fettuccine simply can't compare
    to homemade.
  directions:
  - Combine flour and semolina, then mound on a work surface (preferably wooden).
    Make a well in center and add eggs and 1/2 teaspoon salt to well. (Alternatively,
    put ingredients in a food processor.)
  - Gradually stir enough flour into eggs (using a fork) to form a paste, pulling
    in flour closest to egg mixture and being careful not to make an opening in wall
    of well. Knead remaining flour into mixture with your hands to form a dough (it
    should be firm and not sticky). Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10
    minutes. (If using a processor, blend about 30 seconds total.)
  - Cover dough with an inverted bowl and let dough rest 1 hour to make rolling easier.
  - Divide dough into 8 pieces, then flatten each piece into a rough rectangle and
    cover rectangles with an inverted large bowl. Set rollers of pasta machine on
    widest setting.
  - Lightly dust 1 rectangle with flour and feed through rollers. (Keep remaining
    dough under bowl.) Fold rectangle in half and feed it, folded end first, through
    rollers 7 or 8 more times, folding it in half each time and feeding folded end
    through. Dust with flour if necessary to prevent sticking.
  - Turn dial to next (narrower) setting and feed dough through rollers without folding.
    Continue to feed dough through rollers once at each setting, without folding,
    until you reach the second to narrowest setting. Dough will be a smooth sheet
    (about 36 inches long and 4 inches wide). Cut sheet in half crosswise.
  - Lay sheets of dough on lightly floured baking sheets to dry until leathery but
    still pliable, about 15 minutes. (Alternatively, lightly dust pasta sheets with
    flour and hang over the backs of chairs to dry.) Roll out remaining pieces of
    dough in same manner.
  - Attach fettuccine blades (to cut 1/4-inch-wide strips) to pasta machine. Feed
    one end of driest pasta sheet (the first one you rolled out) into cutters, holding
    other end straight up, then catch strips from underneath machine before sheet
    goes completely through rollers and gently lay across floured baking sheets. (Alternatively,
    lightly flour strips and hang over backs of chairs.) Repeat with remaining sheets
    of pasta. Let pasta dry at least 5 minutes before cooking.
  - Cook fettuccine in a pasta pot of boiling salted water (3 tablespoons salt for
    6 quarts water) until tender, about 2 minutes (do not overcook). Drain.

  desc: '"My profession as a real estate agent requires a lot of my time," writes
    Edi Meadows Morrissette of Westin, Florida, "so it helps that I am lightning-fast
    in the kitchen. I cook every day, and on the weekends I sometimes make three meals
    a day. I accomplish that by following my main cooking principles: (1) do a lot
    of prep work, and (2) keep the kitchen well stocked. For example, at holiday time
    I might chop onions in advance or bake bread the day before company arrives. And
    since I converted the bedroom next to my kitchen into a pantry for extra storage,
    I know I''ll always have the right ingredients at my fingertips."'

    and stir the mixture until it is combined well. In the skillet heat the remaining
    1/2 tablespoon oil over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking, pour in
    the mixture, distributing the ham and bell pepper evenly, and cook the frittata,
    without stirring, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the edge is set but the center
    is still soft. Sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup Swiss cheese over the top. (If the
    skillet handle is plastic, wrap it in a double thickness of foil.) Broil the frittata
    under a preheated broiler and about 4 inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes,
    or until the cheese is golden, and let cool in the skillet for 5 minutes. Slide
    the frittata onto a serving plate, cut it into wedges, and serve it warm or at

  desc: Shaving asparagus with a vegetable peeler transforms the texture of a raw
    stalk into silky strips. This revelatory technique works well with all kinds of
    vegetables, from carrots to zucchini.
  directions:
  - Working with 1 asparagus spear at a time, use a vegetable peeler to shave spears
    into long, thin shavings. Transfer to a medium bowl (the tips will snap off as
    spears get thinner; add to bowl). Combine grated Parmesan and lemon juice in a
    small bowl and slowly whisk in oil until well blended. Season vinaigrette generously
    with salt and pepper. Drizzle vinaigrette over shaved asparagus and toss to coat.
    Divide asparagus salad among plates. Use peeler to shave more Parmesan over salad.

  - Remove foil and parchment from ham. Drain and discard liquids from roasting pan.
    Cut off rind and all but 1/4-inch-thick layer of fat from ham and discard. Using
    long sharp knife, score fat in 1-inch-wide, 1/4-inch-deep diamond pattern. Spread
    mustard evenly over fat layer on ham. Pat brown sugar over mustard coating, pressing
    firmly to adhere. Drizzle honey evenly over. Bake until ham is well glazed, spooning
    any mustard and sugar glaze that slides into roasting pan back over ham, about
    30 minutes. Transfer ham to serving platter; let cool at least 45 minutes. Slice
    ham and serve slightly warm or at room temperature.
  - Sauvignon Blanc is a good match for the ham and the asparagus, a notoriously wine-unfriendly
    ingredient. We like the Joel Gott 2006 Sauvignon Blanc from Napa Valley ($18),
    which has tropical fruit and citrus flavors with floral aromas and a crisp finish.

  desc: This recipe yields enough sauce to glaze three pounds of meat. We doubled
    it for the chicken and ribs at our barbecue party. You'll use about half to marinate
    and glaze the meat while cooking, and the rest as a condiment on the buffet for
    those who like it really saucy.
  directions:
  - Heat the oil in a large saucepan and sweat the onion until tender and translucent.
    Add all remaining ingredients and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the sauce from
    the heat and use a handheld blender to process it to a smooth paste. (Alternatively,
    transfer it to an upright blender and back again.) Simmer gently for an additional
    5 minutes.
  - Separate the sauce into two containers. Use one to marinate and glaze the meat
    during grilling. Reserve the remainder for use as a sauce at the table.

  desc: In Apulia, women still make pasta at home. Their favorite pasta shape - and
    the symbol of the region - is arecchiette, or "little ears". Called recchie or
    recchietelle in the local dialect, orecchiette is eaten just about daily, but
    is prepared a different way in almost every village. The sauces for this whimsical
    pasta are straightforward and usually contain vegetables, beans or legumes. This
    recipe is one of the most basic.
  directions:
  - "Heat oil in heavy small saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and saut\xE9 until\
    \ beginning to color, about 1 minute. Remove from heat."
  - Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until beginning to soften, stirring
    occasionally, about 8 minutes. Add broccoli rabe and cook until pasta is just
    tender, but still firm to bite, about 3 minutes. Drain. Transfer pasta and broccoli
    rabe to large bowl. Pour garlic oil over. Sprinkle with cheeses and toss to coat.

  desc: In spite of my desire to never eat breaded chicken cutlets again, this was
    the first meal I ever made for Andy (at twenty-two, my meal repertoire was about
    as varied as my dad's) and in the years since, the chicken has proven to be a
    real lifesaver in the slap-it-together weeknight meal department. Plus, if you
    have this in your repertoire, you can make "chicken pizza," chicken Milanese (just
    top with an arugula and tomato salad that has been tossed with oil and vinegar),
    and real chicken fingers.
  directions:
  - Add the oil to a large skillet set over medium-high heat.
  - 'Set up your dredging stations: one rimmed plate for the eggs, one plate for the
    flour, and one plate for the bread crumbs. Using a fork, coat your chicken pieces
    first in the flour (shaking off any excess), then in the egg, then in the crumbs,
    pressing the chicken into the crumbs to thoroughly coat.'
  - Fry each breast in the oil for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. (I usually do two
    at a time, but I've been known to cram all of them in at once and then spend the
    entire meal wishing I had just sucked it up and waited the 6 extra minutes.) The
    cutlets are cooked when chicken is firm to the touch but not rock hard.
  - Remove and drain the chicken onto a paper-towel-lined dinner plate tented with
    foil if you have more pieces to fry. Add more oil to the pan and fry the remaining
    breasts.

    and cold water. In a saucepan of boiling water blanch tomatoes, 3 at a time, 2

    tomatoes and add to vodka mixture with dill, pepper, and salt to taste, tossing
    gently. Marinate tomatoes, covered and chilled, at least 30 minutes and up to
    1 hour.

    cut a 3- by 1-inch piece zest from lemon with a vegetable peeler and cut crosswise
    into thin strips.)
  - Just before serving, gently toss tomatoes with a rubber spatula and sprinkle with
    zest. Serve tomatoes with small forks or wooden picks.

  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 450\xB0F. and lightly brush 2 shallow baking pans with oil."
  - Separate garlic head into cloves, discarding loose papery outer skin but keeping
    skin intact on cloves, and wrap in foil, crimping seams to seal tightly. Cut tomatoes
    into 1/2-inch-thick slices and arrange in one layer in baking pans. Sprinkle 2
    teaspoons each of rosemary and thyme evenly over tomatoes and season with salt
    and pepper.
  - Put foil-wrapped garlic in one of baking pans with tomatoes and roast garlic and
    tomatoes in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of pans halfway
    through roasting, about 35 minutes total, or until garlic is tender and tomatoes
    are slightly charred. Unwrap garlic and cool slightly. Peel skins from each clove
    and force pulp with warm tomatoes and herbs through a food mill fitted with small
    disk into a bowl.
  - Finely chop remaining teaspoon rosemary and remaining teaspoon thyme and stir
    into sauce with orange juice. Season sauce with salt and pepper and reheat if
    necessary. Sauce keeps, covered and chilled, 4 days or, frozen, 4 months. Reheat
    sauce over low heat and reseason with orange juice, salt, and pepper.

  desc: Hams with a thick honey glaze can sometimes be too cloying. This recipe takes
    a more balanced approach that results in a light sweetness and a beautiful shine.
  directions:
  - Melt butter with thyme and let stand until ready to use.
  - "Preheat oven to 350\xB0F with rack in lower third."
  - Peel off and discard any rind or skin from ham, leaving 1/4 inch of fat on ham.
    Score fat on top of ham in a crosshatch pattern without cutting into meat. Put
    ham on a rack in a large roasting pan. Cover ham with parchment paper, then cover
    roasting pan with foil. Bake 1 3/4 hours.
  - Meanwhile, boil vinegar in a small saucepan until reduced to about 1 tablespoon.
    Remove from heat and whisk in honey, Worcestershire sauce, and thyme butter. Let
    honey glaze stand until ham has baked 1 3/4 hours.
  - Discard foil and parchment from ham. If there is no liquid in roasting pan, add
    1 cup water (liquid will prevent glaze from burning in pan). Brush ham with half
    of honey glaze, then bake, uncovered, 30 minutes.
  - Brush with remaining glaze and bake until glaze is deep golden-brown and ham is
    heated through, about 30 minutes more.

    it "brings a fresh and sweet take on traditional barbeque sauce." It's fantastic
    over pork or chicken, and it also makes a great sauce to serve with corn bread.
    Kenna Jo calls that "Strawberry BBQ Shortcake."
  directions:
  - In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine half of the strawberries, the chili
    sauce, vinegar, and garlic. Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes
    to thicken. Add the remaining strawberries and cook just until heated through.
