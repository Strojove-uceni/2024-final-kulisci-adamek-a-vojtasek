"my taste in food is pretty simple," writes sara hainsworth of frederick, maryland. "i’m a meat-and-potatoes — and chocolate — kind of person. my husband, greg, and i cook together a lot, which is fun and makes weeknight dinners and cooking for friends easier to manage now that we’re starting our own family. i worked before our son, william, was born, but as my husband says, william is my boss now. so i count on these quick, dependably good dishes more than ever."

note: if you use a flavored salt or old bay seasoning, eliminate the kosher salt.
note: it is important to soak and cook the black beans and the white beans separately because one bean variety can become mushy in the few minutes it takes another to become tender.
note: the deli's recipe calls for both a whole chicken plus of chicken parts. you can, however, use just large chicken and cut off both wings, the neck, and a leg to use as parts.
note: you'll want to use a liquid—rather than a solid—honey for this recipe so it can be drizzled on the lamb.

test-kitchen tip: ask your butcher to bone, butterfly, and trim the leg of lamb for you. save the bone, pop it in the freezer, and use it to make soup or stock.
test-kitchen tip: hardwood lump charcoal is made from pure wood (with no additives or fillers). as the name suggests, this type of charcoal comes in irregularly shaped lumps, unlike the uniformly shaped charcoal briquettes. look for hardwood lump charcoal at natural foods stores, grill shops, and online at sites such as kindlin.com and wickedgoodcharcoal.com.
test-kitchen tip: if you don't have orange liqueur on hand, skip the orange peel and use another liqueur. kahlúa or amaretto would work well in this recipe.
test-kitchen tip: to make sure the chickpeas get crunchy, it's important to dry them thoroughly. spreading them out on paper towels works well.
test-kitchen tip: to release the most flavor from the lemongrass stalk, it's important to coarsely chop and flatten it.
test-kitchen tip: to test for doneness, insert the blade of a small knife deep into the center of the lasagna for seconds. remove the knife and feel the blade. if it's hot, so is the lasagna.

you will need a shovel, a broom, a large canvas tarp that is at least x feet, a couple of big buckets, a few pairs of tongs, two pairs of gloves to protect hands from the steam, a pot to melt butter, a ladle, cheesecloth for wrapping the small food items (such as steamers and periwinkles), twine for tying the cheesecloth bundles and platters for the cooked food. a picnic table is terrific for serving the platters of food but is not absolutely necessary. you will also need plates, cups, bowls for melted butter, eating utensils, lobster crackers, plenty of napkins and several large garbage bags.
you'll often see veal shanks cut crosswise into osso buco, but around the holidays, we like to braise them whole for a dramatic presentation. call in advance so the butcher sets aside the entire pieces for you. there's no need to have them trimmed; the meat will shrink on the bones as it braises.
